One cave featured a formation of various body parts in altered states of deterioration. Initial tests on the dead show the flesh remarkably well preserved. Though dead, some of the biomechanics interwoven in this strange construct appear to keep the parts in a kind of grisly stasis. <br><br> At first, we thought the network of body parts to be evidence of a primitive culture, then we were confronted by a female Assembly cave-dweller. She's an antique and atypical of her modern kind, calling herself Groxum. She appears distraught by our intrusion. Groxum demands we restore her 'sculpture'. She seems unaware of our current era, hearkening from a time when the Star Union had no understanding of the Assembly's morbid instincts. ",
