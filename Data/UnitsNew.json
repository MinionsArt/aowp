            "description": "“Most historians agree that the Star Union was guilty of many atrocities in the pursuit of greatness. Yet nothing is more egregious than what the Imperial factions did to the Penguins. They are a species prone to environmental adaptations, and the Star Union went too far in creating these genetically-modified flightless horrors that lurk amongst the icebergs. If the Star Union ever showed its unbridled hubris, went too far in playing god, and set itself on the path to destruction, it was in the creation of these waterfowl abominations.”<br></br>—Mah Reg’Nib, “RV-4004: Vacation Hotspots”",

These profit-driven middle-managers moved to market so fast, and with so little scientific oversight; they’d infested hundreds of worlds with insectoid juggernaut offspring before realizing their mistake. All because anything that’s alien sells. You can’t just file off a creature’s mandibles and change its nature. The beetle pupae still explode if they die.

I escaped on a child’s hoverboard. Voradons overran the countryside, leading the Star Union eventually to quarantine the planet. Now and then, some military genius will capture a Voradon, thinking to exploit its savage power. The story always ends with blood splatters and screaming.” —Mah Reg’Nib, “RV-2220X: Runaway!”  ",

Long bloody slashes adorned the few remaining hunting dogs that brayed at it. The townsfolk closed in, raising their rifles for the kill. The first shot cracked the air, but the huge red hopper was already gone. It leapt over the dogs and encroaching villagers, striking a soldier.

They are often found swimming with Chelus, performing nurturing tasks for those it deems a friend.

Their core medical directive’s been overwritten to favor self-interest and replication.

A diplomat I knew tried diplomacy to create ‘friendly understanding’ with a Siren. The Siren concurred. The man extended his arm in friendship. The Siren whipped out its piercing tentacles. Poor guy panicked, running around the room, screaming, ‘Too much!’ Finally, his face exploded. Out popped a Psi-Fish Chrysalis. Understanding achieved. As enlightening as that journey might be, I don’t fancy my face exploding. Just saying. Ew.

They spit corrosives, and their powerful penetrating sting absorbs enemy tissue to heal the Soldier Bee.

Near the end of the Heritor Purge, this twisted construct called the Eater of the Dead rose from corrupted essence to consume the fallen on the battlefield. Many men were consumed outright. With each swallowed body, it gained in strength and savagery. I confronted one of the fallen Heritor priests before he was consumed. Choking, he disgorged the words, ‘For Justice!’ then plunged into its hungry maw. Why is it, when men construct gods, they focus solely upon the Law of Justice, ignoring the Law of Mercy?”<br></br>– Mah Reg’Nib, “RV-97009X: Running from Monsters'",

That’s why the more adept members never attack without the support of a mobile network node called a 'Modified Type-A Network Link.' If they turn our machinery against us, focus the assault on the link. Be careful, the link is protected with a gun turret. The link can reset the internal safety protocols of weaponry under its control. Synthesis Daemons are enhanced by the link as well, enabling them to shrug off counter-measures.”— Major Sherwood Gordon, “RV-30400M: Cyberwarfare”",

Encircled by walls of flame, I led Tarrex-IIV’s terrified colonists to an Aegis Tank. My advice in case of a Promethean-caused Inferno: Find an Aegis Tank. Resistant to fire and capable of manipulating its Fallout Shield Dome, we felt cool relief as its protective field encompassed us. Using its kinetic force projector, the tank cleared away obstacles, creating a safe perimeter away from the blaze.

It’s enough to give a man the shivers.”— Night Watchman, Shaquawn Rhodes, “RV-345699E: Ghost Hunters”\r",

Those who receive ritual annihilation can only be revived in the single-minded Great Darkness of malice. I tell you this to strip you down. Other sentiments will destroy you.

Disappointed in the loss of such valuable assets, the team searched the forest. That’s when we saw them: powerful females armed with ultramodern bows. These Huntresses moved like ghosts in and out of the trees. Visible one moment, gone the next. We demanded they surrender their armor and weapons, clearly using modified tech from the old Star Union facility. Ignoring us, they launched a volley of modified arrows, some laced with biotoxins and others that produced blinding flashes.”— Major Matt Maxim, “RV-3424M: Terratech Salvage Mission Gen-II”",

Those monsters eat anything given the chance.  Then witches came. They preached that men were wicked and women didn’t need us. To keep our women safe, we burned the heretics. The hags fled into the low swamps, disappearing among the trees. Nothing survives long there, so we thought them doomed. But the witches enchanted the monsters. They returned riding giant toads with magic cauldrons on their backs. They cast their venom over our walls, destroying Hilltop Fort.”— Mason Monahan, “RV-67588D: Refugee Records”",

Aggression serves the organism. The predator dominates prey, but prey sustains the predator. We Amazons conquered our aggression by removing it from our species. Now, when we apply aggression, we do it deliberately. The Tyrannodon is our vessel. Once savage and untamed, our touch refines it, making it the perfect weapon. We control the apex predator.

The rich and powerful must always appear to have control, following their own exclusive code of dignity. They abhor open acts of aggression, demanding balance and stability. If one gains too much power too quickly, gives too generous a gift, threatens the wrong house, or even marries the wrong person, they risk discrete and decisive assassination. It’s the assassin’s guild that is entrusted with deadly secrets and weaknesses to sabotage even the most powerful enemies. Knowledge truly is power.”—Sir Hao Pearce, “RV-88434A, Assassin’s Credo”",

The old bikes had no Laser Arrays capable of strafing mobs of enemy invaders or focusing all power onto a single target.

A jarring boom sent the lead marauder’s ship flying in three directions. Missiles tore it apart. A Vanguard Battleship loomed out of the smoke. Its cannons blasted a second ship, while its missile launchers reloaded. We hailed it, hoping for lifeboats, but the Battleship unleashed a sparkling charge of warmth over us.

The fallen empire hides powerful secrets yet to be found, a race in earnest to revive the powers hidden in our past. The colonizer is the first step towards that revival. The nurturing of colonies and the development of society is of delicate importance, more so for a foreign and unfamiliar planet with dangers unknown. The cosmic Dark Age is over, and the legendary remnants of the Empire lay dormant, waiting to be rediscovered.”— Quinlinn T. Ortivexis, “RV-4367H: Universal Coincidental History”",
