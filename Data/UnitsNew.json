These profit-driven middle-managers moved to market so fast, and with so little scientific oversight; they’d infested hundreds of worlds with insectoid juggernaut offspring before realizing their mistake. All because anything that’s alien sells. You can’t just file off a creature’s mandibles and change its nature. The beetle pupae still explode if they die. And what happens when Beetle Baby becomes Beetle Adult?” —Professor R. Lin’l “Bugman” Bunson, “RV-181S: Seti Alpha Outpost Recordings”",

When food was no longer treated to pacify people’s instincts, Spacer forefathers embraced their basest nature. They care nothing for aesthetics or civilization. Their only desires are the pleasure devices wherein they live out their cruel fantasies in virtual worlds. Without such devices, ironically, they become even more reckless. They’ll deliberately crash their trucks into enemies, laughing all the way. They think they’re in a shooting, driving game with or without their VR gaming gear.”—Anthropologist, Dr. Sarah Harkness, “RV-6012H: A Past of Twisted Purposes”",

Then I saw a Melter. He was larger than normal. His distorted face looked like melted candlewax. His body was covered in rolls of fat that repelled the acid sloshing in containers on his back. He grinned, pointing a barrel-sized chemical sprayer at our Armored Tank. The acid ate through its armor. We fled on foot as he lobbed cannisters of corrosive gas at our backs.”—Ensign Ryland Grubell, “RV-1274M: Personnel Journal Entries”",

Those daring privateers aren’t to be messed with in a fight with their dual pistol tornado of bullet spray, but what a crazy night on the town! Party animals give new meaning to ‘bouncing off the walls’! My buddy Bonzai didn’t take kindly to thugs. Always causing barfights! Surrounded, she bounced out of a mob of brutes.

They spit corrosives, and their powerful penetrating sting absorbs enemy tissue to heal the Soldier Bee. This is because Growth Soldier Bees are constructed the same way we build a drone; the Growth uses the natural parts of native fauna. The fauna consumes a part of the Growth which hijacks that life.

Upon discovering a cracked case, it plunged its fangs into the occupant, draining the body's essence, turning it into a lifeless husk. The creature's fins crackled with life, as it climbed up the hierarchy of dreaming bodies to a row of Heritor elite where it used its injecting tail to fill their decorative chambers with vitality. It repeated this task, transferring life from the least to the privileged until it spied my camera and spewed entropic rot.”<br></br>– Stealth Specialist Doreen, “RV-838899R: Reconnaissance: Heritor Purge Initiative” \n",

I’ve seen it latch onto the campus security forces, completely draining them of life, only to then watch as their husks explode into a Psionica Tick obedient to the Remora. We sought shelter, but it hurled deadly mind-battering crystals that wracked us with nightmarish regret and agony. I’m afraid that, when you find this record, our school will be nothing more than a ruin, and this whole compound will be overrun with psychic parasites.” – Sully Chesterfield, “RV-8435355M: Pangalactic Academy Journal Entries”",

They’re like walking napalm grenades. Plasmoids became available when research scientists from the Promethean project developed what they called a Phoenix Op Station. There’s a whole protocol to containing the caustic inferno of chemicals that fuel them. Ever since then, these little fiery bots are part of our acquisition cycle. We can order a little extra fire-power, if you catch my meaning.”—Tex ‘Melonballer’ Smith, “RV-6750M: Special Ops and Support”",

Encircled by walls of flame, I led Tarrex-IIV’s terrified colonists to an Aegis Tank. My advice in case of a Promethean-caused Inferno: Find an Aegis Tank. Resistant to fire and capable of manipulating its Fallout Shield Dome, we felt cool relief as its protective field encompassed us. Using its kinetic force projector, the tank cleared away obstacles, creating a safe perimeter away from the blaze.

The colony wants a security guard to make sure nobody enters and tries to dig up dirt on the place. Already two intruders were murdered under mysterious circumstances.

She converted these flying predators into flocks of servants out of love for them. She captured their biometrics for Terratech where it was ignored. After the Revolt, she petitioned the Matriarchy to give her children a purpose among the Amazons. The result is the Shrike: a spy with special affinity for forests, capable of seeing farthest, sporting a low-powered bioelectrical laser gun, and an instinct to swoop at intruders targeting their eyes. A most useful tool for our cause, tamed by our own.”— Archivist Historian Emmilla-Galen, “RV-1109H: A History”",

Our enemies will regret ever returning.”— War Matron Nimue Gaddow, “RV-9994M: Mother’s Nursery for War”",

Ancestral records show leather-clad mobs of two-wheeled ruffians decorated with the flaming skulls of their enemies. Some anthropologists believe the Assault Bike captures that instinctive melancholy—without the skulls, of course. The old bikes had no Laser Arrays capable of strafing mobs of enemy invaders or focusing all power onto a single target. One can only wonder if our ancestors ever would’ve left the open road had they these additional capabilities.”— Professor Quinlinn T.

A month later we were ambushed by bugs, and Sarge gets hit. His PUG was working fine. It was blurred and returning fire with its blasters—all’s good, until Sarge calls for medical. Normally, it’d heal him right up, but instead it sprayed him with chocolate pudding. That’s when the battle took a turn for the worse.”— Lieutenant Lenny Sasse, “RV-333M: Court-martial of Ensign Arnie Malarkin”",

A jarring boom sent the lead marauder’s ship flying in three directions. Missiles tore it apart. A Vanguard Battleship loomed out of the smoke. Its cannons blasted a second ship, while its missile launchers reloaded. We hailed it, hoping for lifeboats, but the Battleship unleashed a sparkling charge of warmth over us.

Her stories haunted me when I saw the Assembly Scavengers wandering lost battlefields, harvesting flesh from the fallen. As basic infantry of the Assembly, one of their arms is replaced with a short-ranged shotgun. Yet, Scavengers don’t eat flesh. They use their long vivisecting claws to amputate viable body parts for transplantation. My left leg was removed at the knee in one such unfortunate encounter. Somewhere out there, a part of me fights for my enemy.”— Mazer Ritalli, “RV-9912M: Synthetic Avalanche”",

It is strange how it focused on the seams around the ship’s engine bracket. That’s a classified weakness. The paranoid agent claims it detects weaknesses. Our aft engines are dead. We’re sitting ducks. We returned fire, but it disappeared under the waters. I’m transmitting this log, because Agent Cranney claims these Shakarn hate public attention. They may hide instead of destroying us.” – Captain Bracken Brady, “RV-393946B: Distress Calls”",

No matter how lowly, I am forever Oathbound.”—Warden Ullen Strig, “RV-030422V: Solemn Devotions”",

We, the Augurs, are scarecrows posted on Fate’s crossroad. Feathery finality flurries like a flock of entropic birds, swirling with possibility. We reach out a hand. We don’t change Fate. We provide the raven of doom a place to perch and then we wait. Waiting. That is when we are most vulnerable. The Augur holds until Doom perches.

The Psynumbra have clearly decided not only to avoid happiness but to fight against anyone who tries to find it. No matter their race, Psynumbra Initiates stoke hatred and malevolence. Cold and dark, Initiates can rob victims of hope. They employ a psionic attack called a Soul Spear, which breaks the mind of an adversary. I try to avoid them.

So the prophet unleashed the Imperial Dragonflies. They poured out a rain of destruction upon the very fools that laughed. From beneath its wings, a spray of angry hornets smote those that raised their weapons. Righteous swarms of fiery darts ripped through their houses, exploding with a concussive roar. Their false temples toppled. Imperial Dragonflies erased their blasphemy. The laughing ceased.”— Fanatic Chul’l Ho, “RV-3390R: Public Notice”",

Some suppose that the troopers are a tool of CORE, desperate criminals being forced to join its ranks. It has been my experience, however, that the deadliest trooper fights not to atone for his past, but to build a better future. For that, CORE and the emperors should be wary.
