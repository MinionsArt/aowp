Our guardsmen struggle to keep them from infesting our underground stores. Though relatively slow, they chew and tunnel below the surface of our settlement. Their bodies are in a state of constant metamorphosis, thus the chemicals they exude are noxious. It is not uncommon to happen upon a group of them in burrows ready to vomit gobs of toxic sludge on any that wander too close to where they feed.\" <br> <i>--Professor R.

The fallen empire hides powerful secrets yet to be found, a race in earnest to revive the powers hidden in our past. The colonizer is the first step towards that revival. The nurturing of colonies and the development of society is of delicate importance, more so for a foreign and unfmiliar planet with dangers unkown. The cosmic Dark Age is over, nd the legendary remnnts of the Empire lay dormant, waiting to be rediscovered.\"  -- Quinlinn T. Ortivexis,\"RV-4367H: Universal Coinidental History\"",
